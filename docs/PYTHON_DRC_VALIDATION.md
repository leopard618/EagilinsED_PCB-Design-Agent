# Python DRC Validation Engine Documentation

## Overview

The Python DRC (Design Rule Check) validation engine performs comprehensive design rule checking on PCB designs without requiring Altium Designer. It analyzes PCB geometry data and design rules to detect violations and manufacturing issues.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **PythonDRCEngine** (`runtime/drc/python_drc_engine.py`)
   - Main DRC engine class
   - Performs all rule checks
   - Returns violations and warnings

2. **DRCRule** (Data Class)
   - Represents a design rule with all parameters
   - Supports all rule types

3. **DRCViolation** (Data Class)
   - Represents a detected violation
   - Contains location, severity, and details

## Supported Design Rules

The Python DRC engine supports the following design rule types:

2. Collect all nets with pads/vias
3. Count pads per net
4. Flag nets with 2+ pads but no tracks

**Example:**
```python

## Validation Logic Details

### Clearance Checking

**Algorithm:**
1. For each pad, calculate its effective radius (size_x/2 or size_y/2, whichever is larger)
2. For each other pad on a different net:
   - Calculate center-to-center distance
   - Calculate edge-to-edge clearance: `distance - radius1 - radius2`
   - If clearance < minimum: report violation
3. Repeat for via-to-pad pairs

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
clearance = sqrt((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²) - radius1 - radius2
```

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Same net pads (skipped)
- Zero coordinates (skipped)
- Missing location data (handled gracefully)

---

### Width Checking

**Algorithm:**
1. Iterate through all tracks
2. For each track:
   - Get track width
   - Compare with min_width_mm and max_width_mm
   - Report violation if outside range

**Edge Cases:**
- Tracks with width = 0 (skipped)
- Missing width data (skipped)

---

### Unrouted Net Detection

**Algorithm:**
1. Collect all nets that have tracks → `nets_with_tracks`
2. Collect all nets that have pads/vias → `nets_with_pads`
3. Count pads per net → `pad_count_per_net`
4. For each net in PCB:
   - Skip if net has tracks (it's routed)
   - Skip if single pad (test point, mounting hole)
   - Skip if no pads/vias (orphaned net definition)
   - Flag if 2+ pads but no tracks

**Why This Logic:**
- Altium doesn't flag single-pad nets (they're typically test points)
- Polygon pours and power planes aren't detectable from track data alone
- Only multi-pad nets without routing are considered violations

---

### Short-Circuit Detection

**Algorithm:**
1. For each pad pair on different nets:
   - Calculate center-to-center distance
   - Calculate combined radius (radius1 + radius2)
   - If distance < combined_radius: pads overlap → short circuit

**Mathematical Formula:**
```
overlap = (radius1 + radius2) - sqrt((x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²)
if overlap > 0: short circuit detected
```

## Limitations

### Data Availability

The Python DRC engine works with data extracted from Altium PCB files. Some limitations:

1. **✅ Polygon/Pour Data** - NOW AVAILABLE
   - Polygon data extracted from `Polygons6/Data` and `Regions6/Data` streams
   - Unrouted net check considers polygon connections
   - Power/ground plane connections detectable via polygon nets

2. **✅ Silk Screen Geometry** - NOW AVAILABLE
   - Silk screen bounds extracted from component data
   - Silk-to-silk checks enabled with bounding box calculations
   - Silk-to-solder-mask checks enabled with clearance validation
   - Uses estimated bounding boxes (full geometry would require footprint library)

3. **⚠️ Complete Net Topology**
   - Net antennae detection partially implemented
   - Full topology analysis requires detailed track segment data
   - Some connectivity paths may not be fully detectable

4. **⚠️ Binary Track Data**
   - Some track records are in binary format
   - Net associations may not be fully reliable
   - Track segment geometry needed for advanced corner/gap checks

### Rule Coverage

- ✅ Clearance constraints
- ✅ Width constraints
- ✅ Via/hole size constraints
- ✅ Short-circuit detection
- ✅ Unrouted net detection (with polygon support)

- ✅ **Routing priority** (priority-based routing validation)

**Note:** Some advanced topology checks (Daisy-Simple, Star) use simplified validation as full graph analysis would require more complex algorithms.

## Rule Format

### Input Format

Rules are provided as a list of dictionaries:

```python
rules = [
    {
        "name": "Clearance Constraint",
        "type": "clearance",  # or "kind": "Clearance"
        "clearance_mm": 0.2,
        "scope1": "All",
        "scope2": "All",
        "enabled": True,
        "priority": 1
    },
    # ... more rules
]
```

### Rule Type Normalization

The engine normalizes rule types from Altium's format:

- `"Clearance"` → `"clearance"`
- `"Width"` → `"width"`
- `"RoutingViaStyle"` → `"via"`
- `"ShortCircuit"` → `"short_circuit"`
- `"UnRoutedNet"` → `"unrouted_net"`
- etc.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue:** Too many false violations
- **Solution:** Check if rules are correctly extracted from PCB
- **Solution:** Verify rule parameters match Altium settings

**Issue:** Missing violations
- **Solution:** Ensure all PCB data is extracted (not truncated)
- **Solution:** Check if rule is enabled

**Issue:** Unrouted net false positives
- **Solution:** This is expected - polygon connections not detectable
- **Solution:** Manually verify nets connected via polygons
